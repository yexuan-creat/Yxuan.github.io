        <h1>Re: 学习</h1>
        <ul>
        <li>学习任务为多媒体嵌入的前三个，但只完成了一个</li>
        <li>专业课的没有完成，明早去图书馆完成</li>
        </ul>
        <P>今晚的班会有位学长来宣讲一个关于皮肤癌的AI+项目并进行招人，感觉很新鲜，他的PPT很高级得我完全不懂的样子；就又再次感觉到，好像我这大三的时间好像的确很尴尬，
        感觉想做个什么丰富提升自己好像来不及了，但时间又好像还多。人生的确该早做选择。</p><br/>
        <p>在打下这些字的时候，室友在说之前她遇到的狗狗，说你对他好他可能会“逗逗”你，你凶它就不敢造次了。就突然发现自己好像有点这样，不太好，得改改。<strong>“我好想主人呐”</strong></p>
        <P>然后室友现在在唱歌，一首摇滚乐曲，然后很欢乐，<em>很喜欢现在的氛围</em>。</p>
        <p>今天室友说她想去兼职，和我谈及18/h的薪资，我突然觉得好少，然后就很想把她拉去做自媒体，歇一阵应该还是会去做自媒体的，把室友拉着做，毕竟这是我擅长的。老师那里过段时间还是会提着礼物去学学琴</P>
        <h2>RE:想念主人  </h2>
        <p>感受到平庸是今天主要基调词，但现在听着室友在喊麦感觉又挺开心很幸福。希望主人身边也有越来越多另主人快乐、舒心的人  </p>
            <li>Turning H2O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C14H12O3.)</li>
            <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30°C (86°F), when the audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 × 103 increasing to 3 × 104.)</li>
            <li>HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.</p >
        <h2>Exotic dance moves</h2>
        <p>Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question, my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:</p >
        <p>
            Polynesian chicken dance
            <p>A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village would dance around in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful".</p >
        </p >
        <p>
            Icelandic brownian shuffle
            <p>Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptibly tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired modern styles such as Twerking.</p >
        </p >
        <p>
            Arctic robot dance
            <p>An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believed to have discovered a new dance style characterized by "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this because they were really cold.</p >
        </p >

        <p>Yours sincerely,</p ><br><br>
